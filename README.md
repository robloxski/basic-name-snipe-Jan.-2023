hey, this is ski, this is a generator taken from https://www.youtube.com/@anxhio3253. i posted this to a github to spread it for others to see. no credits to me, everything you see is made by him.


resources: https://python.org, https://code.visualstudio.com
download both of these before you do anything, when downloading python, add it to PATH


to use: put the file into your desktop, should be something like C:\Users\username\Desktop. if its something like C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Desktop, then just move it out of OneDrive, I had this problem.
to run, open cmd and run 'cd Desktop\Ugen' (without both '). now, just run 'python app.py' (once again without both ') and follow what it tells you then. (before you run the python, it should look like C:\Users\username\Desktop\Ugen)
